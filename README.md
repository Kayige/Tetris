Tetris Game
-----------------------
# Javascript Tetris Clone

An attempt to create a Tetris Game with tutorial guide taken from : https://www.thatsoftwaredude.com/content/8519/coding-tetris-in-javascript-part-1

The original idea was to create a 5-hour project to test my understanding of Javascript. With help from the tutorial to getting started, and scaling it to a full fledged game.
